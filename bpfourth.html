                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            Eternal life—חיי עולם (Hayei Olam)—has long been a central question in religious and philosophical 
                            thought. Is it a literal continuation beyond death? A spiritual state? Or merely a symbolic reward 
                            for righteous living? This article presents a structured “trial” of Hayei Olam, examining historical 
                            perspectives, rebuttals, and a reasoned conclusion.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
                        <p>
                            The concept of eternal life appears repeatedly in Jewish and early Christian texts. Different 
                            sects in the Second Temple period held diverse views:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Pharisees:</strong> 
                                Emphasized resurrection and moral living as the path to eternal reward.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Sadducees:</strong> 
                                Denied afterlife and resurrection, focusing on the present life.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Essenes:</strong> 
                                Advocated strict spiritual discipline and preparation for immortality.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Early Christians:</strong> 
                                Promoted eternal life through faith and union with God, accessible even now.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Later Rabbinic Judaism:</strong> 
                                Synthesized previous teachings, linking ethical conduct to reward in the world to come 
                                (Olam HaBa).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Witness Statements</h2>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Pharisee Witness:</strong> 
                            “Hayei Olam is earned through righteousness and adherence to God’s law. Eternal life awaits those 
                            who live ethically and justly.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Sadducee Witness:</strong> 
                            “Resurrection and afterlife are speculative. Life is for the present; eternal life is irrelevant.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Essene Witness:</strong> 
                            “Only through spiritual discipline and preparation can one achieve eternal life. Life now is 
                            training for eternity.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Early Christian Witness:</strong> 
                            “Eternal life begins with faith and alignment with God. It is both a present reality and a future 
                            hope.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Rabbinic Judaism Witness:</strong> 
                            “Through study, prayer, and ethical conduct, one’s present life determines one’s reward in the 
                            world to come.”
                        </p>
                        <h2>Rebuttal: The Case for Eternity</h2>
                        <p>
                            A key objection arises from the Sadducee perspective: how can we know the afterlife exists if it 
                            cannot be seen? The rebuttal employs analogy:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Air and Wind:</strong> 
                                Invisible yet experienced.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Death:</strong> 
                                Personified, yet representing a transition beyond perception.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            This demonstrates that the existence of eternal life does not require physical proof; the moral and 
                            spiritual consequences of present life serve as evidence.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Scriptural Evidence</h2>
                        <p>
                            One verse resonates deeply with the trial: 
                            <em>
                                “If I have made my bed in Sheol, You are there; if 
                                I have made my bed in Heaven, You are there.”
                            </em>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This affirms that where one “makes their bed” in life—through choices, beliefs, and actions—
                            determines their eternal destination, either in union with or separation from God.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Verdict</h2>
                        <p>
                            After weighing witnesses and rebuttals, the trial concludes:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Eternal Life is the natural result of how one lives, believes, and aligns with God in the 
                                present life.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The righteous, ethical, and faithful shape their eternal reward.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Skeptical objections do not negate the principle; they only remind us of the unseen nature of 
                                eternity.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Scripture, tradition, and philosophical reasoning all converge on this essential truth.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
                        <p>
                            The case of Hayei Olam demonstrates that eternal life is not merely abstract theology—it is 
                            practically connected to the life we lead now. In this sense, the “trial” of Hayei Olam is 
                            settled: the evidence lies in the moral and spiritual choices of the living.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Eternal life, in essence, is where you have already made your bed.
                        </p>
