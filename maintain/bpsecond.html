                        <p>
                            When I first opened a code editor, I didn’t even know how to center a div. Now, I’ve built working websites, written scripts, and grown in ways I never expected. This is the story of how far I’ve come as a self-taught coder — and where I hope to go next.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Starting from Zero</h2>
                        <p>
                            In 2022, fresh out of college and still unsure about my future, I found myself drawn to technology. No job offers were coming in, but I knew I wanted to create something — anything. So I turned to YouTube and typed: “How to build a website.” That search changed everything.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started with HTML — learning how tags worked, how to nest elements, and how to structure a basic webpage. CSS followed, and I remember struggling with positioning and colors at first. But I stuck with it. I paused tutorials, rewound lessons, and copied code line by line.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Breaking Through the Wall</h2>
                        <p>
                            The real turning point was when I made my first website from scratch. No templates, no copy-paste. Just me, the code, and the result on screen. It wasn’t perfect — but it was mine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From there, I built a portfolio. Then a blog. Then an entire set of static websites, each one better than the last. I learned how to use GitHub Pages to publish them online, and how to make them responsive with media queries and flexbox. I even added JavaScript for interactivity.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Lessons from the Code</h2>
                        <p>
                            Every challenge taught me something — not just about syntax, but about persistence. There were days when things wouldn’t align, buttons wouldn’t work, and everything felt broken. But the more bugs I solved, the more confident I became. I didn’t just learn to code. I learned how to think like a coder — to break problems into steps, to debug logically, and to never give up on a project.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What I Know Now</h2>
                        <p>
                            Today, I can say I’m comfortable with:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    HTML5 and CSS3 — including layout tools like Flexbox and Grid
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Basic JavaScript — for toggles, events, DOM interaction
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Responsive design — using media queries for mobile-first websites
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    GitHub Pages — for free site hosting and updates
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Writing, designing, and deploying entire static websites
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I still have a long way to go — but I’ve built a foundation I can trust.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Where I’m Headed Next</h2>
                        <p>
                            The journey isn’t over. I plan to learn JavaScript frameworks like React to improve front-end interactivity. Eventually, I want to learn backend tools, understand APIs, and become a full-stack developer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the same time, I want to continue combining coding with my writing — creating interactive fiction, personal websites, and digital tools that blend creativity with functionality.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            I didn’t come from a tech background. I didn’t study computer science. I didn’t even think I’d be doing this someday. But here I am — building, learning, and sharing what I’ve created.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you’re reading this and thinking of starting your own coding journey, know this: progress takes time. But if you show up, stay curious, and keep typing — you’ll surprise yourself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This blog post is more than just a status update. It’s a milestone — a checkpoint in a long journey I’m proud to be on. Until next time — keep building.
